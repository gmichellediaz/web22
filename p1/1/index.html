    <h1>P1.1 Checkpoint 1</h1>
    <h2>Idea 1</h2>
    <p>Snowboarding: Snowboarding is a winter sport that involves descending a slope that is covered with snow while standing on a board attached to a riderâ€™s feet, using a special boot set onto a mounted binding. The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s to 1970s and became a Winter Olympic Sport in 1998.</p>
    <h2>Idea 2</h2>
    <p>Soccer: Soccer is a form of football played between two teams of 11 players, in which the ball may be advanced by kicking or by bouncing it off any part of the body but the arms and hands, except in the case of the goalkeepers, who may use their hands to catch, carry, throw, or stop the ball. </p>
    <h2>Idea 3</h2>
    <p>History of a music artist or band: Would this idea be possible? Possibly do the history of how they started and where they are now. I would probably chose Bad Bunny or BTS.</p>
